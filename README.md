# UH Poster SEG

## Introduction

This is a presentation (slides) template for both Society of Exploration Geophysicists (SEG) meeting and University of Houston. Note that this is unofficial template and designed by Yuchen Jin, who is a Ph.D student in Dept. ECE.

This template has been tested on [TexLive 2017][texlive], Windows successfully. Some reports show that it may not work with MikTex or MacTex. Please adjust it by yourself if you are using a different platform.

This template is adapted from [**The Beamer poster version of the Radboud University Corporate Style poster Template**][poster-radboud]. Note that the original template is issued by *Creative Commons CC BY 4.0* (see [CC-BY-4-0][license-cc]). There is another license in this branch. The appearance is almost the same as the original work. However, this template has such improvements:

* According to SEG's standards, the template is modifed as a 94in * 46in page.
* A totally new thanks page.
* Support with necessary packages like amsmath, subfigure, algorithm and some other tools.
