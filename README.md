# UH Beamer Templates

## Introduction

This is a collection of beamer templates designed by Yuchen Jin (cainmagi). Since they are adapted from other templates, we may apply different licenses to different templates. If anyone who want to use these templates, please pay attension to the licenses.

Beamer could be used to produce presentations (slices), posters, cheet sheets and some other products. In this project, we would add different types of templates in the future.

Currently this collection includes:

| Beamer title | Type | Screenshot|
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| UH-Slices-ECE | Presentation |  |
| UH-Slices-SEG | Presentation |  |
