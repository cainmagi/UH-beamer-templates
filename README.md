# UH Slides SEG (2020)

## Introduction

This is a presentation (slides) template for both Society of Exploration Geophysicists (SEG) meeting and University of Houston. Note that this is unofficial template and designed by Yuchen Jin, who is a Ph.D student in Dept. ECE.

This template has been tested on [TexLive 2021][texlive], Windows successfully. Some reports show that it may not work with MikTex or MacTex. Please adjust it by yourself if you are using a different platform.

This template is adapted from [**Beamer template for Lund University**][slice-lu]. The appearance is almost the same as the original work. However, this template has such improvements:

* Specially designed for SEG 2020 meeting, you could check the original version [here][SEG-2020-Slides].
* Involve the SEG 2020 logo. And we support the second logo if you hope to display it.
* Support both 4:3 and 16:9 modes. We have provided the title page and thanks page for both versions.
* A totally new thanks page.
* Support with necessary packages like cleveref, subfigure, algorithm and some other tools.
